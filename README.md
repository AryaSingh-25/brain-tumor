Here’s a clean and professional `README.md` file tailored for your brain tumor detection project — especially since it's part of the larger [multi\_disease\_prediction](https://github.com/deoprakash/multi_disease_prediction) project.

# Brain Tumor Detection using MobileNetV2 (Flask Web App)

This is a sub-project of the [Multi Disease Prediction](https://github.com/deoprakash/multi_disease_prediction) system. It provides a simple web interface to detect brain tumors using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 deep learning model.

## 🧠 Overview

This web app allows users to upload MRI brain images and predicts whether the image indicates:

- Glioma Tumor
- Meningioma Tumor
- Pituitary Tumor
- No Tumor

The model is built using **MobileNetV2** and wrapped in a **Flask** web application.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone this repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AryaSingh-25/brain-tumor.git
cd brain-tumor
````

2. **(Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the Flask app:**

```bash
python appbrain.py
```

5. **Open your browser and go to:**

```

## 🧪 Model Details

* Architecture: MobileNetV2
* Input size: 224x224
* Output: 4 classes
* File: `mobilenetv2_model.h5` (should be <100MB to be hosted on GitHub)

---

## 📸 Usage

1. Upload a brain MRI image via the web interface.
2. The model predicts the class of tumor (or no tumor, with 4 subclasses).
3. The result and confidence are displayed on the same page.

## 🧩 Part of Larger Project

This is a modular part of the [Multi Disease Prediction Project](https://github.com/deoprakash/multi_disease_prediction), which aims to detect various diseases using deep learning models and a unified interface.
